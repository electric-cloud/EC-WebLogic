WebLogic is a server software application that runs on a
middle tier, between back-end databases and related
applications and browser-based thin clients. The main
features of WebLogic server include connectors that make it
possible for any legacy application on any client to
interoperate with server applications, Enterprise JavaBean
(EJB) components, resource pooling, and connection sharing
that make applications very scalable. An administration
console with a user interface makes management tasks more
efficient and features such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
support for the encryption of data transmissions, as well
as authentication and authorization mechanisms, make
applications and secure.
