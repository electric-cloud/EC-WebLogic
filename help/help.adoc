Plugin version @PLUGIN_VERSION@

Revised on May 21, 2024





== Overview


== {PRODUCT} integration to WebLogic

The WebLogic plugin integrates with the Oracle WebLogic server for:

* Application and server management.
* Interacting or editing existing applications.
* Deploying new applications.
* Starting and stopping both managed servers and the administration server
* Using Jython scripting to create script files or to enter a new embedded file.

== Integrated version

This plugin was developed and tested against following WebLogic Server Versions:

* 12c (12.2.1.1.0) on Windows
* 12c (12.2.1.1.0) on Linux
* 11g (10.3.6.0) on Windows
* 11g (10.3.6.0) on Linux

== Updated Perl version required

This plugin uses an updated version of Perl and requires {PRODUCT} agent version 10.3 or later.












== Plugin configurations

Plugin configurations are sets of parameters that can be applied
across some, or all, of the plugin procedures. They
can reduce the repetition of common values, create
predefined parameter sets, and securely store credentials.
Each configuration is given a unique name that is entered
in the designated parameter for the plugin procedures that use them.


=== Creating plugin configurations

To create plugin configurations in {PRODUCT}, complete the following steps:

. Navigate to menu:DevOps Essentials[Plugin Management > Plugin configurations].

. Select *Add plugin configuration* to create a new configuration.

. In the *New Configuration* window, specify a *Name* for the configuration.

. Select the *Project* that the configuration belongs to.

. Optionally, add a *Description* for the configuration.

. Select the appropriate *Plugin* for the configuration.

. Configure the parameters per the descriptions below.

=== CreateOrUpdateDatasource


This procedure creates a new generic JDBC Data Source or updates an existing one based on the update action.



==== CreateOrUpdateDatasource parameters
[cols="1a,1a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

| __**Configuration**__ | Name of the configuration to be used. URL, port, and credentials are retrieved from the specified plugin configuration.


| __**Datasource name**__ | Unique name of the JDBC generic data source to be created.


| __**DataSource driver class**__ | The full package name of the JDBC driver class used to create the physical database connections in the connection pool. Note that this driver class must be in the classpath of every server to which it is targeted/deployed.


| __**Database URL**__ | JDBC URL of the database to connect to. The format of the URL varies by JDBC driver. The URL is passed to the JDBC driver to create the physical database connections. Examples:
        




 * jdbc:spssoem:mysql://<host>:<port>;DatabaseName=<database>

 * jdbc:spssoem:oracle://<host>:<port>;SID=<database>[;AuthenticationMethod=kerberos].


| __**JNDI name**__ | JNDI path to where this datasource is bound (for example, jdbc/MYDS). By default, the JNDI name is the name of the datasource. Applications that look up the JNDI path will get a javax.sql.Datasource instance that corresponds to this datasource.


| __**Datasource credentials**__ | Username and password for the database.


| Database name | Name of the database/default schema for the database connection. Note that this may be relevant to some databases (for example, MySQL), but may not be necessary for all databases. This parameter is not required if it is already defined in the 
 *JDBC URL*  parameter.


| JDBC driver properties | Newline-separated list of property=value pairs passed to the JDBC driver that are used to create physical database connections (for example, server=dbserver1).




NOTE: For security reasons, when the WebLogic server is running in production mode, you cannot specify database passwords in this properties list because it will cause datasource deployments to fail. To override this security check, use the commandline argument "weblogic.management.allowClearTextPasswords" when starting the server.
    


| Target server list | Comma-separated list of servers the datasource should target. If targets are not specified, the datasource is created, but not deployed.


| Update action | The update action to take when a connection factory with the same name already exists:
        




 *  *Do nothing (default):*  No action is taken upon an update (for example, it will be a NO-OP).

 *  *Remove and create:*  The existing connection factory is removed, and it is recreated based on the new parameters passed.

 *  *Selective update:*  The existing connection factory is updated only for parameters that are designed to be updated out-of-the-box.


| Additional options | If selected, specify optional parameters (for example, the initial pool size, minimum pool size, maximum pool size, and validation SQL).
