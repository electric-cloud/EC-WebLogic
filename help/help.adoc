Plugin version @PLUGIN_VERSION@

Revised on September 21, 2020





== Overview

== {CD} Integration to WebLogic

Use this plugin to interact with the Oracle WebLogic server for application
and server management, interacting or editing existing applications, and deploying new applications.
You can start and stop both the Managed Servers and the Administration Server
using this integration. You can use Jython scripting to create script files
or to enter a new embedded file.

== Integrated Version

This plugin was developed and tested against following WebLogic Server Versions:
 - 12c (12.2.1.1.0) on Windows
 - 12c (12.2.1.1.0) on Linux
 - 11g (10.3.6.0) on Windows
 - 11g (10.3.6.0) on Linux











== Plugin Configurations
Plugin configurations are sets of parameters that apply
across some or all of the plugin procedures. They
reduce repetition of common values, create
predefined parameter sets for end users, and
securely store credentials where needed. Each configuration
is given a unique name that is entered in designated
parameters on procedures that use them.


=== Creating Plugin Configurations
To create plugin configurations in {CD}, do these steps:

* Go to **Administration** &gt;**Plugins** to open the Plugin Manager.
* Find the @PLUGIN_NAME@ row.
* Click *Configure* to open the
     Configurations page.
* Click *Create Configuration* as per the description of parameters below.


*After you perform the setup below it is important to make sure that the {CD} agent machine on which WebLogic runs is registered as a resource that can be pinged.*

image::cloudbees-common::cd-plugins/ec-weblogic/config/ec-wlsconfig.png[image]

*Note:* In the URL, the protocol is "t3" or "t3s". The
RMI communications in WebLogic Server use
the "t3" protocol to transport data between WebLogic
Server and other Java programs, including clients and
other WebLogic Server instances. A server instance
keeps track of each Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with
which it connects, and creates a single "t3" connection
to carry all traffic for a JVM.


=== Configuration Procedure Parameters
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|Configuration Name | 

|WebLogic URL | URL of WebLogic Server (must include protocol, server and port). Two protocols are supported: t3 and t3s, e.g. t3://weblogic:7001.


|WLST Script Absolute Path | Absolute path to WLST. i.e: '/path/to/wlst.cmd' or 'wlst.sh'. Setting this path will make applying the equal param in procedures unnecessary.


|JAVA_HOME | JAVA_HOME environment variable, i.e. path to bin, where java executable is located. This variable will be set every time procedure runs for the job environment. Warning: the behaviour of the procedure can become unpredictable, if the same resource is shared across multiple EF instances. If this option is set, JAVA_VENDOR should be also set.


|JAVA_VENDOR | JAVA_VENDOR environment variable, use it to specify java vendor. This variable will be set every time procedure runs for the job environment. Warning: the behaviour of the procedure can become unpredictable, if the same resource is shared across multiple EF instances. If this option is set, the option JAVA_HOME should be also set. 


|MW_HOME | MW_HOME environment variable, use it to specify WebLogic Home directory. This variable will be set every time procedure runs for the job environment. Warning: the behaviour of the procedure can become unpredictable, if the same resource is shared across multiple EF instances.


|Login as | Username and password to connect to WebLogic server.


|Enable named sessions? | 
            If checked, each WebLogic edit session will have unique name assigned. Named sessions are not supported by WebLogic server prior to 12 version. Defaults to false.
        


|Test Connection? | Check if connection should be established during config creation to validate credentials.


|Test Connection Resource | A resource which is used for the testing connection.


|Debug level | Debug level, higher debug level - more debug messages. Warning: on debug level 10 and more passwords will be revealed in a procedure logs.Verbosity level of output.

This procedure creates a new generic JDBC Data Source or updates an existing one based on the update action.



==== CreateOrUpdateDatasource Parameters
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
| Parameter | Description

| Configuration | Name of the configuration to be used. URL, port and credentials are retrieved from the given configuration.


| Datasource Name | Unique name of the JDBC generic Data Source to be created.


| DataSource Driver Class | The full package name of JDBC driver class used to create the physical database connections in the connection pool. (Note that this driver class must be in the classpath of every server to which it is targeted/deployed).


| Database URL | The JDBC URL of the database to connect to. The format of the URL varies by JDBC driver. The URL is passed to the JDBC driver to create the physical database connections. These are some examples.
jdbc:spssoem:mysql://<host>:<port>;DatabaseName=<database>
jdbc:spssoem:oracle://<host>:<port>;SID=<database>[;AuthenticationMethod=kerberos].


| JNDI Name | The JNDI path to where this Datasource is bound. For example jdbc/MYDS
By default, the JNDI name is the name of the Datasource. Applications that look up the JNDI path will get a "javax.sql.Datasource" instance that corresponds to this Datasource.


| Datasource Credentials | Username and password for the Database.


| Database Name | Name of the Database/Default Schema to which the Database connection is to. Note that this may be relevant to MySQL (for example) and in general may not be necessary for all Databases. Further this name can be mentioned as part of the JDBC URL above. There is as such no need to use this parameter if it is already defined in the JDBC URL like above.


| JDBC Driver Properties | The list of properties passed to the JDBC driver that are used to create physical database connections. For example: server=dbserver1. List each property=value pair on a separate line.Note:For security reasons, when WebLogic Server is running in production mode, you cannot specify database passwords in this properties list. Data source deployment will fail if a password is specified in the properties list. To override this security check, use the command line argument "weblogic.management.allowClearTextPasswords" when starting the server.
    


| Target Server List | A list of comma separated list of Servers on which the Data Source should be targeted. If targets are not specified, Data Source will be created but not deployed.


| Update Action | This parameter controls as to what the Update Action should be when a DataSource with the same name exists:



 *Do Nothing (Default)*  - The procedure will take no action upon an update (i.e., will be a NO-OP), if this option is chosen.



 *Remove and Create*  - The procedure would remove existing DataSource and recreate it based on new parameters passed.



 *Selective Update*  - The procedure would update existing DataSource credentials and Server Target List.



| Additional Options | Use this option to specify optional parameters for example initial pool size, min pool size, max pool size, validation SQL etc.

[[CreateOrUpdateConnectionFactory]]
=== CreateOrUpdateConnectionFactory


Creates or updates Connection Factory


WebLogic Server defines two default connection factories, which can be looked up using the JNDI names weblogic.jms.ConnectionFactory and weblogic.jms.XAConnectionFactory.

This procedure is used to create and configure a new connection factory for an existing JMS module if the pre-configured settings of the default factories are not suitable for your application.

It is recommended to use default targeting for the Connection Factory, i.e. do not use Subdeployments.


==== CreateOrUpdateConnectionFactory Parameters
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
| Parameter | Description

| Configuration Name | Name of the configuration to be used. URL, port and credentials are retrieved from the given configuration.


| Connection Factory Name | Unique name of the Connection Factory that is created.


| JMS Module Name | Name of the JMS module in which the Connection Factory is created.


| Subscription Sharing Policy | The Connection Factory Subscription Sharing Policy Subscribers can be used to control which subscribers can access new subscriptions.Values can be either Sharable or Exclusive.
        


| Client ID Policy | The Client ID Policy indicates whether more than one JMS connection can use the same Client ID. Oracle recommends setting the Client ID policy to Unrestricted if sharing durable subscribers. Subscriptions created with different Client ID policies are always treated as independent subscriptions.
        


| JNDI Name | JNDI Name is used to lookup the Connection factory using JNDI lookup. If the connection factory is created without passing this parameter, it can be only used in an Application Scoped context.


| Maximum Messages per Session | This  limit specifies the number of messages that can be queued for an asynchronous session. Default value  is 10.


| XA Connection Factory Enabled? | Indicates if this connection factory should  create XA queues and XA topics in order to accommodate JTA aware transactions. Default is Yes.


| Subdeployment Name | Name of Subdeployment. Required only if you do not  want default targeting and instead want to use advanced targeting.


| Target WLS Instance List | 
        Comma delimited set of Weblogic Server instances (Standalone or cluster) to which the Connection Factory would be targeted to.




        Required only if Subdeployment Name is specified.
        


| Target JMS Server List | Comma delimited set of JMS Servers to which the Connection Factory would be targeted to.
Required only if Subdeployment Name is specified. 


| Update Action | 
This parameter controls as to what the Update Action should be when a Connection Factory with the same name exists:



 *Do Nothing  (Default)*  -  The procedure will take no action upon an update (i.e., will be a NO-OP), if this option is chosen.



 *Remove and Create*  - The procedure would remove existing Connection Factory and recreate it based on new parameters passed.



 *Selective Update*  - The procedure would update existing Connection Factory. The parameters for selective update are 
 *JNDI Name*  and 
 *Subdeployment Name* .
        


| Additional Options | 
Use this option to pass related parameters that pertain to Delivery, Client, Transaction or Flow Control. E.g., 
 *DefaultDeliveryParams.DefaultPriority=5* .
Several options are separated by a newline:




DefaultDeliveryParams.DefaultPriority=5
FlowControlParams.FlowMaximum=500
FlowControlParams.FlowControlEnabled=true
