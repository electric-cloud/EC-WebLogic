Plugin version @PLUGIN_VERSION@

Revised on April 11, 2022





== Overview


== {PRODUCT} Integration to WebLogic

Use this plugin to interact with the Oracle WebLogic server for application
and server management, interacting or editing existing applications, and deploying new applications.
You can start and stop both the Managed Servers and the Administration Server
using this integration. You can use Jython scripting to create script files
or to enter a new embedded file.

== Integrated Version

This plugin was developed and tested against following WebLogic Server Versions:
 - 12c (12.2.1.1.0) on Windows
 - 12c (12.2.1.1.0) on Linux
 - 11g (10.3.6.0) on Windows
 - 11g (10.3.6.0) on Linux












== Plugin configurations

Plugin configurations are sets of parameters that apply
across some or all of the plugin procedures. They
reduce repetition of common values, create
predefined parameter sets for end users, and
securely store credentials where needed. Each configuration
is given a unique name that is entered in designated
parameters on procedures that use them.


=== Creating plugin configurations

To create plugin configurations in {PRODUCT}, do these steps:

* Go to menu:Administration[Plugins] to open the Plugin Manager.
* Find the @PLUGIN_NAME@ row.
* Click *Configure* to open the
 Configurations page.
* Click *Create Configuration* as per the description of parameters below.



=== Configuration procedure parameters

[cols=",",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|__**Configuration name**__ | 

|__**WebLogic URL**__ | URL of WebLogic Server (must include protocol, server and port). Two protocols are supported: `t3` and `t3s`, e.g. `t3://weblogic:7001`.


|__**WLST script absolute path**__ a|
Absolute path to WLST. i.e: `/path/to/wlst.cmd` or `wlst.sh`. Setting this path will make applying the equal param in procedures unnecessary.

NOTE: You need to install the agent to the machine that has access to the WLST script at least.
  


|JAVA_HOME a| `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, i.e. path to bin, where Java executable is located. This variable will be set every time procedure runs for the job environment. 

IMPORTANT: The behaviour of the procedure can become unpredictable, if the same resource is shared across multiple EF instances. If this option is set, `JAVA_VENDOR` should be also set.


|JAVA_VENDOR a| `JAVA_VENDOR` environment variable, use it to specify Java vendor. This variable will be set every time procedure runs for the job environment. 

IMPORTANT: The behaviour of the procedure can become unpredictable, if the same resource is shared across multiple EF instances. If this option is set, the option `JAVA_HOME` should be also set. 


|MW_HOME a| `MW_HOME` environment variable, use it to specify WebLogic Home directory. This variable will be set every time procedure runs for the job environment.

IMPORTANT: The behaviour of the procedure can become unpredictable, if the same resource is shared across multiple EF instances.


|Login as | Username and password to connect to WebLogic server.


|Enable named sessions? | 
If selected, each WebLogic edit session will have unique name assigned. Named sessions are not supported by WebLogic server prior to version 12. Defaults to `false`.
  


|Test connection? | Check if connection should be established during config creation to validate credentials.


|Test connection resource | A resource which is used for the testing connection.


|Debug level a| Debug level, higher debug level - more debug messages.

IMPORTANT: On debug level `10` and more, passwords will be revealed in a procedure `logs.Verbosity` level of output.

This procedure creates a new generic JDBC Data Source or updates an existing one based on the update action.



==== CreateOrUpdateDatasource parameters
[cols=",",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

| __**Configuration**__ | Name of the configuration to be used. URL, port, and credentials are retrieved from the given configuration.


| __**Datasource name**__ | Unique name of the JDBC generic Data Source to be created.


| __**DataSource Driver Class**__ | The full package name of JDBC driver class used to create the physical database connections in the connection pool. (Note that this driver class must be in the classpath of every server to which it is targeted/deployed).


| __**Database URL**__ a| The JDBC URL of the database to connect to. The format of the URL varies by JDBC driver. The URL is passed to the JDBC driver to create the physical database connections. Examples:

* `jdbc:spssoem:mysql://<host>:<port>;DatabaseName=<database>`
* `jdbc:spssoem:oracle://<host>:<port>;SID=<database>[;AuthenticationMethod=kerberos]`


| __**JNDI name**__ | The JNDI path to where this Datasource is bound. For example jdbc/MYDS
By default, the JNDI name is the name of the Datasource. Applications that look up the JNDI path will get a `javax.sql.Datasource` instance that corresponds to this Datasource.


| __**Datasource Credentials**__ | Username and password for the Database.


| Database name a| Name of the Database/Default Schema to which the Database connection is to.

NOTE: This may be relevant to MySQL (for example) and in general may not be necessary for all Databases. Further this name can be mentioned as part of the JDBC URL above. There is as such no need to use this parameter if it is already defined in the JDBC URL like above.


| JDBC Driver Properties a| The list of properties passed to the JDBC driver that are used to create physical database connections. For example: `server=dbserver1`. List each property=value pair on a separate line.

IMPORTANT: For security reasons, when WebLogic Server is running in production mode, you cannot specify database passwords in this properties list. Data source deployment will fail if a password is specified in the properties list. To override this security check, use the command line argument `weblogic.management.allowClearTextPasswords` when starting the server.

|Parameter |Description

| __**WebLogic URL**__ | URL of WebLogic Server (must include protocol, server and port). Two protocols are supported: t3 and t3s, e.g. `t3://weblogic:7001`.


| __**WLST script absolute path**__ a|
Absolute path to WLST. i.e: `/path/to/wlst.cmd` or `wlst.sh`. Setting this path will make applying the equal param in procedures unnecessary.

NOTE: You need to install the agent to the machine that has access to the WLST script at least.


| JAVA_HOME a| `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, i.e. path to bin, where Java executable is located. This variable will be set every time procedure runs for the job environment.

IMPORTANT: The behaviour of the procedure can become unpredictable, if the same resource is shared across multiple EF instances. If this option is set, `JAVA_VENDOR` should be also set.


| JAVA_VENDOR a| `JAVA_VENDOR` environment variable, use it to specify Java vendor. This variable will be set every time procedure runs for the job environment.

IMPORTANT: The behaviour of the procedure can become unpredictable, if the same resource is shared across multiple EF instances. If this option is set, the option `JAVA_HOME` should be also set.


| MW_HOME a| `MW_HOME` environment variable, use it to specify WebLogic Home directory. This variable will be set every time procedure runs for the job environment.

IMPORTANT: The behaviour of the procedure can become unpredictable, if the same resource is shared across multiple EF instances.


| Login as | Username and password to connect to WebLogic server.


| Enable named sessions? | 
If checked, each WebLogic edit session will have unique name assigned. Named sessions are not supported by WebLogic server prior to version 12. Defaults to `false`.


| Test connection resource | A resource which is used for the testing connection.


| Debug level | Debug level, higher debug level - more debug messages.

IMPORTANT: On debug level 10 and more, passwords will be revealed in a procedure `logs.Verbosity` level of output.
