This procedure runs Jython scripts using weblogic.WLST. The
WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST) is a command-line
scripting interface that system administrators and
operators use to monitor and manage WebLogic Server
instances and domains. The WLST scripting environment
is based on the Java scripting interpreter, Jython. In
addition to WebLogic scripting functions, you can use
common features of interpreted languages, including
local variables, conditional variables, and flow
control statements.
